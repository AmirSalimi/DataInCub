Design	and	implement	a	binary	image	classifier	based	on	the	provided	images	<./ds_craft>	
without	using	an	OCR	engine.		The	two	labels	should	be	[1099_misc,	other].		The	provided	
images	are	contained	in	folders	named	
based	on	ground	truth	labels.		Prioritize:
a.
Classifier	relevance
b.
Inference	time	speed
2.
Assess	the	relevance	of	the	classifier
